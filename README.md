### Hi, my name is Jake Windsor.
I am currently developing web applications primarily using React.js and TailwindCSS with either Node.js or GoLang and MongoDB for the backend and database.
I have also recently started learning GoLang and PHP/Laravel, Vue.js and mySQL.
Previously I have learnt very small amounts of C# and Unity to create games and Java to create Minecraft plugins.

I also have my own business, [Synify](https://synify.net), where we host private and public game servers for customers, I have majorly modified the panel based on [Pterodactyl Panel](https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel). The github for the business is [here](https://github.com/synify-ltd)
